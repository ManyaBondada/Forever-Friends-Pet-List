        "description":"Hey, my name is Leroy. I'm not meaner than a junkyard dog but my foster mom says I might make a great guard dog. I watch over her very closely and am always looking around corners for a ground attack. Course, being a Dachshund, sniffing is what I do. I might go behind you when there's a big dog around, but I will bark loudly. Foster mom also says I'm as sweet as the day is long. I love a lap, walks, and being outside. Having a lot of time outside is new to me. Did you know about all of the smells? And how awesome is it to roll in the grass?! I'm getting the hang of being house and crate trained. I got a late start but catching on quickly since I'm so smart. I'm a little bit shy when I meet new people but warm up quickly. And in case you didn't notice, I carry a little extra weight but my foster mom is helping me walk that off. So when you see me, I will look thinner (plus the camera adds pounds).",

        "description":"Quinn loves her person to no end. She's a GREAT companion...and we mean AMAZING. Playing with her is an amazing experience! She retrieves, plays tug and keep-away. She's great on leash. Quinn's foster home has other dogs, but she doesn't seek the other dogs out for play. She is really just all about her person/people, so would be a great only dog. She's beautiful, loving and very cuddly. She greets every morning with a big hug! She is not a barker. She prefers a couch to a kennel and enjoys a car ride. Quinn is a consistent 48lbs. She's a pretty calm girl with med/low energy except when excited about a leash or a toy. She can be over enthusiastic about greeting new people, but we can tell you more about how to do that properly. She's a smart girl, so best suited for someone smarter than her (has dog savvy or experience). Quinn was nearly euthanized at the shelter and we are SO glad we saved her. We are in LOVE with Quinn. She will make someone very happy. She'd be great with a person, a couple or family with older kids - just as long as it's the right fit!",

        "description":"If you are looking for an affectionate and loving puppy, Parker may be just the one for you! He's curious and just the right amount of play. He does have the cutest little stubby legs! Parker is very friendly and social. He is potty trained and doing great over all learning all the things that puppies need to learn. His litter was found abandoned, sadly, but they have been receiving care in our foster program and have learned how to be good little house-pups. They are healthy, adorable and ready for fun!",

        "description":"Hazel is a gorgeous social butterfly ready for her forever home. She was found as a stray but has quickly been picking up manners like house and crate training. Hazel loves to get head scratches, play, chew on her toys, go for walks, and give lots of love to her people. Hazel will need a slow introduction and few days to get used to any other dogs in the home. She sleeps through the night, rarely barks, and is a joy to have around. This sweet pup would be a great addition to any family!",

        "description":"Meet Mama Half Stash! This beautiful fluffy Siamese mix girl and her three tiny babies were found in a warehouse when the kittens were only 9 days old. The owner of the business scooped them up and put them in an ice chest as that was all he had at the time. He reached out to TMHPR and we stepped up to help this sweet family. The beautiful babies, Snap, Crackle and Pop were cared for by this very good mother and she is now an empty-nester, ready for her forever home. Mama HS is a bit shy at first but once she trusts you, she will choose love over food or toys. She is especially affectionate in the morning and loves her wet food for breakfast but then likes to find a cozy spot for a good long afternoon nap. She perks up in the evening and loves to play with her spring toys - her favorite! She would do best in a quiet home on her own or with another cat friendly kitty or calm dog.",

He loves belly rubs and will quickly fall asleep while getting his nightly belly rubs. He is incredibly patient and kind with small children holding him. He continues to be the kid favorite.",
